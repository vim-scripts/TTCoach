*ttcoach*
Most of Vim users are excellent touch typers but for beginners and even
intermediate users it is important to train their skills. TTCoach
provides possibility to do this and offers simple statistics.

==============================================================================
1. Installation					*ttcoach-installation*

Unpack file ttcoach.zip from level of your .vim or vimfiles directory.
It will unpack files:
    ttcplug.vim      - into plugin directory
    ttcoach.vim      - into new created macros/ttcoach directory
    ttcoach.txt      - into doc directory
    keyboard layouts - into new created macros/ttcoach directory
    layouts defs     - into macros/ttcoach directory
    exercise files   - into new created directories:
		       macros/ttcoach/en,fr,de,pl,finger,custom,vim

Not messing with this structure is important for use TTCoach out-of-the-box
(at least on *nix systems).
To install doc file (this file) follow instructions in |add-local-help|.

TTCPLUG.VIM

For proper work on non-*nix systems and use non English keyboard layout you
have to modify some variables in file plugin/ttcplug.vim |ttcoach-variables|.
Or set up them in your |vimrc| file.

==============================================================================
2. Theory of touch typing			*ttcoach-theory*


1. Keep your fingers on home-row [asdf-hjkl;].
2. After each keystroke come back to home-row position.
3. Don't move to next lesson until your accuracy is below 98%.
4. Accuracy is much more important than speed.

3. How to use					*ttcoach-manual*

START 						*ttcoach-start*

Command ":TTCoach" will split screen in two parts. On top will be list of
keyboard shortcuts used in TTCoach, bottow will be Explorer window with
exercises to choose.

You can also use command ":TTExplore". It will open standard Vim
file explorer in directory with exercise files proper for |g:ttcoach_layout|.
More help about explorer here: |pi_expl.txt|.

Choose one of files. It will open with proper syntax highlighting.

TYPING 						*ttcoach-typing*

If you want to see keyboard with highlighted current keys press <F3>, if you
don't want to hints press <F2>. It will prepare test (zero statistics, time,
close help window).
	Both keys place cursor under first letter of test. To start typing
press "i" or "I". It also starts timer. The end of line is marked with "÷".
When cursor is under this character press "CR" to go to next line (in fact two
lines down). After each fault you get 0,5 s penalty. You can adjust it - more
about it |g:ttcoach_penalty|. End typing with <Esc> or <C-[>. It also ends
timer.
	If you want to start exercise not from first line go to desired
position and press <F4>, i or I. It will highlight corresponding key on
keyboard. You can start only from first character in line.


STATUSLINE 					*ttcoach-statusline*

Statusline offers some information about current exercise: name of the layout
(L), name of exercise (E), current accuracy (A). Also presents the most
necessary shortcuts:
<F1> - show short help, if help window is opened close it
<F2> - restart current exercise, clear statistics
<F3> - restart current exercise, clear statistics and show keyboard
<F5> - create statistics
<F6> - open Explorer window
<F9> - quit

Note: these are most important shortcuts. Not all.

STATISTICS 					*ttcoach-statistics*

Now, you can see your statistics with <F5> (number of typed keys, number of
faults, time, characters per minute, words per minute, faults per letter,
faults per finger). After long test table can be huge:

Number of keystrokes:   1371
Number of faults:       25
Accuracy:               98%
Time:                   311s
Characters per minute:  264
Words per minute:       45
---- Faults per letter -----
    e:          3       11%
    s:          5       19%
    f:          1       3%
    p:          1       3%
    a:          2       7%
    n:          2       7%
    i:          1       3%
    t:          3       11%
    d:          1       3%
    u:          1       3%
    o:          1       3%
    l:          1       3%
    r:          1       3%
    y:          1       3%
     :          1       3%   <- fault with space
---- Faults per finger -----
L. pinky:       2       7%
Left ring:      5       19%
Left middle:    4       15%
Left index:     5       19%
Thumbs:         1       3%
Right index:    4       15%
Right middle:   1       3%
Right ring:     2       7%
R. pinky:       1       3%

Statistics are written automatically to stats.dat in your current language
directory with information about lesson and date. All statistics you can see
with <F8>. End exercise with <F9>.

CAVEATS 					*ttcoach-caveats*

It is recommended to start separate session for use TTCoach because
ttcoach.vim clears all imap and iab commands and resets some options
(eg. 'virtualedit').
	It can also resize Gvim window |g:ttcoach_application_mode|.

==============================================================================
4. Commands 					*ttcoach-commands*
						*:TTExplore*
:TTExprore [{la}]
		There is only one command ":TTExplore". It opens file explorer
		window with exercise files in directory according to value of
		|g:ttcoach_layout|. If you want exercise another layout use
		eg: ":TTExplore de". But physical keyboard layout you have to
		change outside Vim (eg. in Mandrake Control Center). In some
		cases you have also change font. Special argumenst are
		"custom" for viewing custom created files and "vim" for
		exercizes with Vim commands.

		But eg. German letters even in not in your "official" layout
		can be entered with digraphs.

						*:TTCoach*
:TTCoach [{la}]
		It will open new session of TTCoach with screen split in two
		parts. On top short help, bottom will be Explorer. Also here
		you can use session type shortcuts (language, vim, custom)

						*:TTCustom*
:TTCustom {filename}
		Open custom file prepared for training. Add empty lines, line
		endings etc.

						*:TTCustomSave*
:TTCustomSave
		Save prepared file in {ttcoach_dir}/custom directory. You can
		access it later with ":TTCoach custom" command.
==============================================================================
5. Mappings 					*ttcoach-mappings*

<F1>						*ttcoach-F1*
		Show short help about shortcuts.

<F2>						*ttcoach-F2*
		Removes typed letters and places cursor at start position (3rd
		line, 1st column).

<F3>						*ttcoach-F3*
		Prepares file for lesson with view of keyboard. Adds proper
		keyboard layout (depending on value of |g:ttcouch_layout|).
		Splits window on two parts.  In upper is text of exercise.
		Below is keyboard layout. Current characters will be
		highlighted. You can also start new exercise with this key.

<F4>						*ttcoach-F4*
		Sometimes you want to start typing not from the beginning.
		Moving the cursor is easy. <F5> will highlight proper key on
		keyboard.
		Note you can start typing only from first character of the
		line.

<F5>						*ttcoach-F5*
		Statistics. You will see number of typed keys, number of
		faults. accuracy in percents, time, speed (characters per
		minute) and number of faults per key and finger. Statistics
		will be zeroed after <F2> command.

<F6>						*ttcoach-F6*
		Open Explorer window.

<F7> 						*ttcoach-F7*
		Empty.

<F8> 						*ttcoach-F8*
		View statistics. Command opens file with statistics and places
		cursor at the end of file.

<F9>						*ttcoach-F9*
		End exercise. The same effect as :qa!.

==============================================================================
6. Variables 					*ttcoach-variables*

From version 0.5 variables can be set in your |vimrc| file.

						*g:ttcoach_layout*
Default value is "en". This variable is responsible for attaching keyboard
layout to exercise file and turning on proper imaps and keys highlighting.
Possible values: en, fr, de, pl, sk.

						*g:ttcoach_dir*
Default value "~/.vim/macros/ttcoach". Root directory for TTCoach files. For
MS-Windows it should be something like: "f:\vim\vimfiles\macros\".

						*g:ttcoach_application_mode*
Turned off by default. If you use gvim. application_mode will resize gvim
window to 11 lines, 80 columns. Thus keyboard will be just under typed text.
Another reason to run TTCoach as separate session. Use with care.

						*g:ttcoach_penalty*
Default 1 milisecond. Length of penalty after fault. If you want another
value read before changing: |:sleep|.

						*g:ttc_target_speed*
Default 200 (chars per minute).

						*g:ttc_target_accuracy*
Default 98 (%). These two variables will affect choices and defaults after
your exercises.

==============================================================================
8. Goals 					*ttcoach-goals*

Together with statistics after pressing <F5> you will see short advice what
you should do next. Enter char in brackets and press <CR>. Choice in [] is
default and this choice will be executed after <CR> without entering of char.

Choice and defaults are created by comparing results of current exercise and
goals. Default values are 98% for accuracy and 200 chars per minute. You can
change them for session by choosing this option after finishing one of the
exercises with well results. Change settings forever by editing file
plugin/ttcplug.vim and changing values of g:ttc_target_accuracy and
g:ttc_target_speed variables or setting them in your |vimrc| file.
==============================================================================
8. Excercise files 				*ttcoach-exercise*

TTCoach has exercise files for English-qwerty, German-qwertz and French-azerty
keyboards. They are coming from Ktouch <http://edu.kde.org/ktouch> and were
created by author of this program Haavard Froeiland
<haavard@users.sourceforge.net>. Thus now TTCoach is GPL.

I have created also exercise files for Polish letters. They are also special
files for Vim lovers :) Call ":TTExplore vim". Explorer will open with files
ex1.ttc, ex2.ttc (ex commands aka command-line commands, also for use in Vim
scripts), nv.ttc (commands of normal and visual mode).

You can alos create your own custom files with ttcustom.pl. This is a perl
script for extracting words from file and writing them in TTCoach format to
file: >

    ttcustom.pl ~/.vim/CVIMSYN/engspchk.dict a y i > custom/ayi.ttc

This command will extract from engspchk dictionary (or other HUGE file) 100
words, each of them contains letters 'a' and 'y' and 'i' (it is possible to
define up to three letters).  You can practise with this file entering to Vim
and with command ":TTExplore custom".  Your keyboard layout will be saved,
alas you can not combine eg. ":TTExplore de vim".

Names of files should be meaningful. For example: 09pq.ttc - 09 level of
exercise (and help for systems where case of letters doesn't matter); pq -
these letters sponsor exercise; .ttc - information for autocommand from
ttcplug.vim .

SYNTAX 						*ttcoach-syntax*

Syntax of exercise files is very simple:
	First line is header (re: /^".*"$/)
	Next lines are lines to rewrite (re: /.*÷$/)

Both parts are obligatory.

Exercise file can not be longer than 505 lines. This means up to 250 lines for
exercise and circa 5000 chars to type. If this is not enough for you let me
know.
